 *
 * The Benthos Logbook Library is a C++ class library for manipulating scuba
 * diving logbook databases stored in the Benthos format.  It exposes dives,
 * dive sites, dive computers, profiles, gas mixes and more as C++ classes with
 * a lightweight ORM layer for persistence through SQLite.  Benthos lobgooks
 * are stored as SQLite databases for interoperability; the schema is provided
 * with this library and is open for third-party clients.
 *
 * The library is organized into three major portions: logging, low-level
 * SQLite database access and the object-relation mapper.  The logging package
 * provides a Python-like logging functionality which is used to report
 * debugging information, and supports logging namespaces with individual
 * reporting and formatting options.  The database access layer provides C++
 * wrappers around the SQLite API to facilitate the object-relational mapper.
